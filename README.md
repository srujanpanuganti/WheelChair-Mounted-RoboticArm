# Project - Wheel Chair Mounted Robotic Arm
This Project models a Wheel Chair mounted Robotic Arm which can be used as an aid for Quadriplegics to interact with the environment

This Project models the Forward Kinematics of Kinova Robotics Jaco Arm attached to a wheel chair 
This Project also models the Inversre Kinematics of Kinova Robotics Jaco Arm attached to a wheel chair
The project also validates both the Forward and Inverse Kinematics
